<!-- Book 1 Up & Going
	Ch 1 Into Programming 

	Statements:
		
		A group of words, numbers, and operators that perform a specific task is a statement. 

		EX: a = b * 2;

		Programs are just a collection of many statements, whic together describe all the steps that it takes to perform your program's purpose

	Expressions:
		
		Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is any reference to a varialbe or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.

		EX: a = b * 2;

		This statement has 4 expressions in it:

			- 2 is a literal expression
			- b is a variable expression
			- b * 2 is an arithmetic expression
			- a = b * 2 is an assignment expression, as it assigns the product as "a". 


			-->


			<script> 

			a = 21;
			b = a * 2;
			console.log( b );

			</script>

	<!--

	Output 

	In the previous code snippet we used console.log( b )

	log ( b ):
	 	is a function call. What's happening is we're handing the b variable to that function, which asks it to take the value of b and print it to the console.

	console. : 
		is an object reference where the log( b ) function is located.
	
	Input
	
	The most common way is by using HTML forms and having JS read values into program variables.

	You can also use prompt(..) function. -->
	<script>
		age = prompt("What is your age?");

		console.log(age);
	</script>


<!--
	Operators

	Are how we perform actions on variables and values

	Common JS Operators:

		Assignment: = as in a = 2.
		
		Math: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), as in a * 3 or 2 / 4

		Compound assignment: += , -= , *= , and /= are compound operators that combine a math operation with assignment, as in a += 2 (same as a = a + 2);

		Increment/Decrement: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), as in a++ (a = a + 1);

		Object Property Access: . as in console.log().
			
			Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. obj.a means an object value called obj with a property with of the name a. 

			Properties can alternatively be accessed as obj["a"].

		Equality: == (loose-equals), === (strict-equals), != (loose-not-equals), !== (strict-not-equals) as in a == b or a !== b.

		Comparison: < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or loose-equals), >= (greater than or loose-equals), as in a <= b.

		Logical: && (and), || (or), as in a || b that sleects either a or b.


	Values & Types

	When you express values in a program, you choose different representations for those values based on what you plan to do with them.

	These different representation for values are called TYPES in programming terminology. JS built-in types:

		When you need to do math, you want a NUMBER.

		When you need to print a value on the screen, you need a STRING (one or more characters, words, senctences).

		When you need to make a decision on your program, you need a BOOLEAN (true or false).

	Values that are included directly in the source code are called LITERALS. STRING literals are surrounded by double quotes "..." or single quotes '...' (the only difference is stylistic preference). NUMBER and BOOLEAN literals are just presented as is (42, TRUE, etc).

-->
	<script>
		
		"I am a string";
		'I am also a string';

		42

		true;
		false;

	</script>

	
	<!--

	Converting between types

	Converting between types in JS is called "coercion".

	If someone enters a series of numeric characters into a form on an ecommerce page, that's a STRING, but if you need to then use that value to do math operations, you need to "coerce" it to a NUMBER.

	JS offers several different facilities for forcibly coercing between types.

	-->

	<script>
		
		var a = "42";
		var b = Number(a);
		
		console.log ( a );
		console.log ( b );

	</script>

	<!--

	Using Number(..) as shown is an "explicit" coercion from any other type to the number type.

	When comparing string "99.99" and the number 99.99, you'd think they're equivalent, right? You could say they're "loosely equal".

	JS coerces them "implicitly" when comparing them loosely. Ex: "99.99" == 99.99 is true because JS implicitly coerces "99.99" to a number, but "99.99" === 99.99 is false because it's comparing by type.

	
	Code Comments

	Comments are lines of code to explain things to a human, and won't be read by the interpreter/compiler.

	Guidelines:

		Code without comments is suboptimal

		Too many comments (one per line, for example) is probably a sign of poorly written code.

		Comments should explain why, not what. They can optionally explain how if that's particularly confusing.

	In JS, you have single-line comments and multiline comments.

	Single-line: // asdfadasasdf //
	
	Multi-line: /* wfasdasdfd
					sfsdfgsdfg
					dfsfdsafsfd
					sdsdasdf
							*/
	Variables

		When you assign a value to a symbolic container, you assing it to a "variable"- so called because the value in this container can vary over time as needed.

		Static typing, happens when you declare a variable (container) to hold a specific TYPE of value, such as a NUMBER or STRING. Some programming languaes use this.

		JavaScript uses weak typing, or dynamic typing. which allows a single variable to represent a value no matter what type form the value takes at any given moment.
		Variables can hold values of ANY TYPE without any TYPE enforcement (static typing).

		To declare a variable we use var:

		-->

		<script>
			
			var amount = 99.99;
			amount = amount * 2;
			console.log( amount );

			//Convert amount to string and add "$" symbol

			amount = "$" + String( amount );
			console.log(amount);

		</script>
		
		<!--

		Note that the variable "amount" holds a running value that changes over the course of the program, illustrating the primary purpose of variables: managing program "state"

			State means tracking the changes to values as your program runs.

		Constants are variables with values that do not change over time. In JavaScript they're usually capitalized, with underscores between multiple words.

		AS OF JAVASCRIPT ES6:

		const TAX_RATE = 0.08;

		var amount = 99.99;

		-->

		<script>
			
			const TAX_RATE = 0.08; // 8% sales tax

			var amount = 99.99;

			amount = amount * 2;

			amount = amount + (amount * TAX_RATE);

			console.log(amount); // 215.9784
			console.log(amount.toFixed(2)); // "215.98"

			//toFixed(..) lets us specify how many decimal places we'd like the number rounded to.

		</script>

		<!--

		Constants also prevent accidentally changing value somewhere else after the initial setting. If you tried to assign a different value to TAX_RATE after that first declaration, your program would reject the change.
